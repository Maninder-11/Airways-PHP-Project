                    <h1>Disneyland Park -  Anaheim, California</h1>
                    <p>Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland, is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney. It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s. It was the first Disney theme park.
					Walt Disney came up with the concept of Disneyland after visiting various amusement parks with his daughters in the 1930s and 1940s. He initially envisioned building a tourist attraction adjacent to his studios in Burbank to entertain fans who wished to visit; however, he soon realized that the proposed site was too small. After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project, Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953. Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955.</p>
                    <h3>California at a Glance</h3>
                    <p><b>Weather:</b> Santa Barbara has long been recognized as having arguably the best climate in the state with the best weather in the U.S. (California).</p>
                    <p><b>Best Time to Visit:</b> The best travel time for California is from May to September. In these months it is sunny, warm and the likelihood of rain is very low. April and October are also good months for a Californian getaway! Holidaymakers who can't stand high temperatures, I would recommend avoiding the period from July to August.</p>
